These classes are the Syntax Highlighter for the FR80 and TX19 Assembly languages.
The first version of the flex (and java) file was generated using TokenMakerMaker - see http://fifesoft.com/blog/?cat=7
(load the AssemblerFr.xml config file)
The result was integrated according to this thread : http://fifesoft.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=268
Then some parts were merged with AssemblerX86TokenMaker and result was recompiled with JFlex (see post above)

Instructions:
1) install JFlex 1.4.3
2) do changes in .flex files
3) start JFlex and select .flex file and do "generate" - .java file will be generated
4) remove second definitions of functions zzRefill() and yyreset(). 
   Generated .java file contains 2 definitions of these functions: optimized 
   versions from .flex file and second are generated by JFlex.
